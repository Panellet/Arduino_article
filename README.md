## Arduino-code.ino

The Arduino-code.ino must be compiled and uploaded to an Arduino/Genuino UNO Board using the Arduino IDE.
(https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/howto)

When the code is compiled and uploaded, the board can be used to perform an experimentation where an analog signal between
**-1V and +1V** (it is important to not overpass this boundaries) is provided to the **analog pin A0**. 

Also, the code allows to communicate the board with the application RoboRemo app installed on a Smartphone
which will be recieving via OTG USB the digital signal converted by te board.


## roboremo-interface.interface

The RoboRemo app interface allows to read, visualize and save in the Smartphone the digital signal provided by the
Arduino/Genuino board.  

The steps to import the interface are:
1. Copy the interface file to the RoboRemo app folder on the Smartphone
2. Open RoboRemo app in the Smartphone
3. Select menu -> interface -> import
4. Choose the file
